$$$ Introduction $$$
HDS OPE file Editor (HOE) is a tool-program to make operation files
for your observations with HDS (High Dispersion Spectrograph) of
Subaru Telescope, NAOJ.
It also has a function as Echelle format simulators for HDS.

If you can access to the intra-net of Subaru Telecope,
you can download it via
    http://hds.jpn.org/wiki/
  (But, you need a password to enter this page.)


$$$ Environment $$$
This program is running under UNIXs with X window sytems,
or MS Windows (Win2k, WinXP).

For compiling this program, Gtk+-2.0 development environment is necessary
at least. (For Win, use MinGW + Gtk-dev).
The latest versio of HOE (ver2.x) needs Gtk+-2.x (2.8 or later).

Now, ver1.9.0 has a SkyMonitor function, using cairo library.
You need Gtk+2.8 or later to use this function (The configure-script
will automatically detect the library.).



$$$ How to Make (for UNIX, linux & Solaris) $$$
  - Extract archives, go to the extraced directory.

  - % ./configure

  - % make

Then, an executable file "hoe" should be built.
You can copy this file to other directory as you like.


$$$ How to Make (for Windows) $$$
Basically, Win32 version will be served as binary packages.

Developement environment should have  msys + min-gw + gtk-dev + grwin.
You can find a manuscript to build almost same developping environment
in
   http://sylpheed.sraoss.jp/wiki/index.php?Sylpheed%2FWin32
(A mailer soft for UNIX/Win32 compatible)¡¡¡¡

  - ./configure --with-win32

  - make

   (or makewin32.sh script will do all above process in Win32 wnvironment)
¡¡

$$$ Input Text File $$$
[1] For usual observation
You should prepare target list text files for your observation.

	HD94028     ,105128.1 ,+201639.0 ,2000,  <Comments>
	BD+36 2165  ,111248.0 ,+354343.9 ,2000,  Mv=8.4  Fe/H=-2
	HD97916     ,111554.2 ,+020512.1 ,2000,  Mv=10.2 Fe/H=-2
	BD+51 1696  ,114635.2 ,+505254.7 ,2000   
	BD-13 3442  ,114650.7 ,-140643.5 ,2000,
           .....................

Cammas are the separator of each column.
      (Object Name), (RA), (Dec), (Epoch), <comments (if necessary>
You should write "until sec" of RA/Dec.
(They are regarded as floating poiint arguments [f09.2, f+010.2 etc.])
You can write some comments in the last column, if you want.

This file can be read from the menu or "-i" option in starting.


[2]For Planet Search
This is the special mmode for Planet Hunting observation.
This type of observations required to handle over hundred objects per night.
In 5th column of input text file, you should describe (V) magnitudes 
of each targets.

	HD94028     ,105128.1 ,+201639.0 ,2000,   8.5, <Comments>
	BD+36 2165  ,111248.0 ,+354343.9 ,2000,   8.4, Mv=8.4  Fe/H=-2
	HD97916     ,111554.2 ,+020512.1 ,2000,  10.2, Mv=10.2 Fe/H=-2
	BD+51 1696  ,114635.2 ,+505254.7 ,2000    7.4,
	BD-13 3442  ,114650.7 ,-140643.5 ,2000,   8.2,
           .....................
 

If you want to use this planet search mode, you should use "Open List
for Planet Search" in the menu.
Under this PS mode, You can use
  - Autmatic exptime calculation
    (Input ideal exptime in "Exp for Mv=8", then "Update"->"Exptime"
    in the menu bar)
  - SetUpField_PS, GetObject_PS instead of SetupField and GetObject
    Optimized skeltons for simultaneous operations of readout and
    telescope slewing.


$$$ Save and Re-edit $$$
Edit some parameters and save OPE from the menu.
And all settings of hoe can be saved in *.hoe file ("Save Config" in
the menu).Its very useful to re-edit your observing plan.


$$$ Obs Plan Editor $$$
HOE version 2.x or later has "Obs. Plan Editor" to support making
observation plan.
You can run this function form the menu bar ("Edit"->"Obs. Plan
Editor").
In this editor, the necessary time for each task will be calculated
automatically. Therefore, you can easiliy know the time table in
observing night. SunSet/Rise and Twilight time are also inserted
automatically.

After build your observational plan, please choose "File"->"Write OPE
w/Plan" in the menu bar of the editor. Then, an OPE file following
your plan will be created automatically.


$$$ Upload OPE file to SOSs $$$
Since ver 1.9.6, if you input correct SOSs ID and passwod in GUI,
you can upload OPE files in your system to SOSs directly via HOE.
The inside protocol is sftp using python + paramiko script.
Please Install
 - Python (and you should set the correct path to run "python" command.)
 - paramiko (SSH2 protocol for python)
 - pycrypt (only for Windows)

You should use this function only inside of STN.
Your passwords are saved in your .hoe files by ASCII text.
So, please be careful to use this function.
